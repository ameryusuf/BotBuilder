        "- We are using our classifier on the same data we used for training it. In a real setting, this is a very bad practice as it will likely lead to overfitting: producing a classifier that works well for the data it was trained on but can't really generalize for out-of-sample cases. The way you avoid this is by separating your data in a training dataset and a test dataset. Then you use the training set for training and the test set for evaluating its performance.\n",
        "- You probably noticed that the dataframe `df_tfidf` is a sparse matrix. Sparse matrix are common results of TF-IDF encoding. You can use principal component analysis to reduce the matrix into a few meaningful components and work with that. This will make the computation easier.\n",
